# This example parses ambiguous English sentences.  The target annotation
# is Penn Treebank's syntactic bracketing tags.  For details, see
# http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/

# This example originally came from Ralf Muschall.  Ruslan Shvedov
# reworked my implementation, converting it to the SLIF and
# Penn Treebank.  Ruslan and Ralf clearly know English grammar better than
# most of us native speakers.

# 'time', 'fruit', and 'flies' can be nouns or verbs, 'like' can be
# a preposition or a verb.  This creates syntactic ambiguity shown 
# in the parse results.

# Modifier nouns are not tagged or lexed as adjectives (JJ), because
# "Nouns that are used as modifiers, whether in isolation or in sequences,
# should be tagged as nouns (NN, NNS) rather than as adjectives (JJ)."

# The saying "time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana"
# is attributed to Groucho Marx, but there is no reason to believe
# he ever said it.  Apparently, the saying
# first appeared on the Usenet on net.jokes in 1982.
# I've documented this whole thing on Wikipedia:
